# Motif
(**Mo**derator **T**ools **I**mproved **f**or Stack Exchange)

## Features

- View flags inline on the post, without having to load the more cluttered timeline or flag list.
- Moves the "show deleted comments" link next to the "add comment" link, Ã  la [SEMTI](https://github.com/animuson/se-mod-tools-improved).
- Moves the timeline link next to the other post actions

## Planned

- Filtering for the timeline to sort by relevant action

## Design Philosophy

Inspired heavily by animuson's [SEMTI](https://github.com/animuson/se-mod-tools-improved), but designed to only show relevant
information as required rather than all post actions below the post.

Frequently use one part of the mod tools that's difficult to access? 
[Feature requests always welcome](https://github.com/TheIoTCrowd/motif/issues).
